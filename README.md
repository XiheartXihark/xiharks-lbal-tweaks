Base game tweaks for Luck Be A Landlord

# Version 1.0.0
Patched the following symbols:
- Cat
- Cultist
- Magpie
- Mouse
- Ninja
- Owl
- Rain
- Turtle
- Wolf

Overall, these changes will make the game feel easier. These tweaks added additional interactions between symbols, and as a result, coin is easier to earn.
Currently, there is no intent to add or remove any symbols to/from the base game. Further balancing to offset the lower difficulty is likely required.
